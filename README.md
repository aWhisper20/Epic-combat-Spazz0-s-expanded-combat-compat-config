# Epic-combat-Spazz0-s-expanded-combat-compat-config
A config file for Epic combat which allows for compatibility with spazz0's expanded combat.
To use, paste file into the .minecraft subfolder "config" and let it override the original "epicfight.toml".
To revert changes simply remove the "epicfight.toml" file from the folder and lauch the game. Epic combat mod will automatically make a new config file on game startup.

DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR CREATING THE TWO ASSOCIATED MODS NOR THEIR CONFIGS, I AM ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MODIFICATIONS MADE TO THIS PREEXISTING CONFIG.
